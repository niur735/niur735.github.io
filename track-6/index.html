		<p>When the train left Tokyo Station, Tengo took out the paperback that he had brought along. It was an anthology of short stories on the theme of travel and it included a tale called “Town of Cats,” a fantastical piece by a German writer with whom Tengo was not familiar. According to the book’s foreword, the story had been written in the period between the two World Wars.</p>
		<p>In the story, a young man is travelling alone with no particular destination in mind. He rides the train and gets off at any stop that 	arouses his interest. He takes a room, sees the sights, and stays for as long as he likes. When he has had enough, he boards another 	train. He spends every vacation this way.</p>
		<p>One day, he sees a lovely river from the train window. Gentle green hills line the meandering stream, and below them lies a pretty 	little town with an old stone bridge. The train stops at the town’s station, and the young man steps down with his bag. No one else gets 	off, and, as soon as he alights, the train departs.</p>
		<p>No workers man the station, which must see very little activity. The young man crosses the bridge and walks into the town. All the 	shops are shuttered, the town hall deserted. No one occupies the desk at the town’s only hotel. The place seems totally uninhabited. 	Perhaps all the people are off napping somewhere. But it is only ten-thirty in the morning, far too early for that. Perhaps something has 	caused all the people to abandon the town. In any case, the next train will not come until the following morning, so he has no choice but 	to spend the night here. He wanders around the town to kill time.</p>
		<p>In fact, this is a town of cats. When the sun starts to go down, many cats come trooping across the bridge—cats of all different kinds 	and colors. They are much larger than ordinary cats, but they are still cats. The young man is shocked by this sight. He rushes into the 	bell tower in the center of town and climbs to the top to hide. The cats go about their business, raising the shop shutters or seating 	themselves at their desks to start their day’s work. Soon, more cats come, crossing the bridge into town like the others. They enter the 	shops to buy things or go to the town hall to handle administrative matters or eat a meal at the hotel restaurant or drink beer at the 	tavern and sing lively cat songs. Because cats can see in the dark, they need almost no lights, but that particular night the glow of the 	full moon floods the town, enabling the young man to see every detail from his perch in the bell tower. When dawn approaches, the cats 	finish their work, close up the shops, and swarm back across the bridge.</p>
		<p>By the time the sun comes up, the cats are gone, and the town is deserted again. The young man climbs down, picks one of the hotel 	beds for himself, and goes to sleep. When he gets hungry, he eats some bread and fish that have been left in the hotel kitchen. When 	darkness approaches, he hides in the bell tower again and observes the cats’ activities until dawn. Trains stop at the station before 	noon and in the late afternoon. No passengers alight, and no one boards, either. Still, the trains stop at the station for exactly one 	minute, then pull out again. He could take one of these trains and leave the creepy cat town behind. But he doesn’t. Being young, he has 	a lively curiosity and is ready for adventure. He wants to see more of this strange spectacle. If possible, he wants to find out when and 	how this place became a town of cats.</p>
		<p>On his third night, a hubbub breaks out in the square below the bell tower. “Hey, do you smell something human?” one of the cats says. 	“Now that you mention it, I thought there was a funny smell the past few days,” another chimes in, twitching his nose. “Me, too,” yet 	another cat says. “That’s weird. There shouldn’t be any humans here,” someone adds. “No, of course not. There’s no way a human could get 	into this town of cats.” </p>
		<p>“But that smell is definitely here.”</p>
		<p>The cats form groups and begin to search the town like bands of vigilantes. It takes them very little time to discover that the bell 	tower is the source of the smell. The young man hears their soft paws padding up the stairs. That’s it, they’ve got me! he thinks. His 	smell seems to have roused the cats to anger. Humans are not supposed to set foot in this town. The cats have big, sharp claws and white 	fangs. He has no idea what terrible fate awaits him if he is discovered, but he is sure that they will not let him leave the town alive.</	p>
		<p>Three cats climb to the top of the bell tower and sniff the air. “Strange,” one cat says, twitching his whiskers, “I smell a human, 	but there’s no one here.”</p>
		<p>“It is strange,” a second cat says. “But there really isn’t anyone here. Let’s go and look somewhere else.”</p>
		<p>The cats cock their heads, puzzled, then retreat down the stairs. The young man hears their footsteps fading into the dark of night. 	He breathes a sigh of relief, but he doesn’t understand what just happened. There was no way they could have missed him. But for some 	reason they didn’t see him. In any case, he decides that when morning comes he will go to the station and take the train out of this 	town. His luck can’t last forever.</p>
		<p>The next morning, however, the train does not stop at the station. He watches it pass by without slowing down. The afternoon train does the same. He can see the engineer seated at the controls. But the train shows no sign of stopping. It is as though no one can see 	the young man waiting for a train—or even see the station itself. Once the afternoon train disappears down the track, the place grows 	quieter than ever. The sun begins to sink. It is time for the cats to come. The young man knows that he is irretrievably lost. This is no 	town of cats, he finally realizes. It is the place where he is meant to be lost. It is another world, which has been prepared especially 	for him. And never again, for all eternity, will the train stop at this station to take him back to the world he came from.</p>
		<p>Tengo read the story twice. The phrase “the place where he is meant to be lost” attracted his attention. He closed the book and let 	his eyes wander across the drab industrial scene passing by the train window. Soon afterward, he drifted off to sleep—not a long nap but a deep one. He woke covered in sweat. The train was moving along the southern coastline of the Boso Peninsula in midsummer.</p>
