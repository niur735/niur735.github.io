    <p>I am a person who believes that enjoyment is the final goal for all human in this world and even treat it as my life creed in some way. I think that beauty is the most important part that makes up the enjoyment, especially art. Because of this, I decided to study in an area that about beauty, about art. I hope that by creating artworks, analyzing artworks and sharing my feeling about artworks, I could always live in an enjoyable situation. The art not only just stand there like a symbol, but convert into power to push me to walk farther.</p>
